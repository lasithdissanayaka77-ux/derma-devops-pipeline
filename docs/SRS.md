    <br/>

**6\. Data Model (Database Schema)**

To support the Patient and Doctor workflows, the following relational database schema (Postgres/Supabase) is proposed<sup>56</sup>:

**6.1 Table: Users**

- id (Primary Key, UUID) <sup>57</sup>  
    <br/>
- email (String, Unique) <sup>58</sup>  
    <br/>
- password_hash (String, Encrypted) <sup>59</sup>  
    <br/>
- full_name (String) <sup>60</sup>  
    <br/>
- role (Enum: 'patient', 'doctor') <sup>61</sup>  
    <br/>
- created_at (Timestamp) <sup>62</sup>  
    <br/>

**6.2 Table: Cases**

- id (Primary Key, UUID) <sup>63</sup>  
    <br/>
- user_id (Foreign Key -> Users.id) <sup>64</sup>  
    <br/>
- image_url (String, Path to storage) <sup>65</sup>  
    <br/>
- ai_analysis_text (Text, The initial result from Gemini) <sup>66</sup>  
    <br/>
- chat_history (JSONB, Stores the Q&A conversation context) <sup>67</sup>  
    <br/>
- review_status (Enum: 'pending', 'reviewed', 'appointment_requested') <sup>68</sup>  
    <br/>
- reviewed_by (Foreign Key -> Users.id, Nullable) <sup>69</sup>  
    <br/>

**6.3 Table: Appointments**

    <br/>
- doctor_id (Foreign Key -> Users.id) <sup>73</sup>  
    <br/>
- requested_date (Timestamp) <sup>74</sup>  
    <br/>
- status (Enum: 'pending', 'confirmed', 'completed') <sup>75</sup>  
    <br/>

**7\. AI System Prompt & Configuration**

7.1 Persona Definition

The AI System Prompt is the core "intelligence" instruction set sent to the API. It ensures the model behaves consistently and legally 76.

System Prompt Draft:

"You are a helpful, empathetic, and professional dermatology assistant. You will be provided with an image of a skin condition. Your task is to:

- Analyze the visual characteristics of the skin condition (color, texture, shape, distribution)<sup>77</sup>.  
    <br/>
- Suggest 2-3 potential dermatological conditions that visually match these characteristics<sup>78</sup>.  
    <br/>
- **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are an AI, not a doctor<sup>79</sup>.  
    <br/>
- You **MUST** prefix your entire response with the following text exactly: 'DISCLAIMER: I am an AI assistant. This analysis is for informational purposes only and does NOT constitute a medical diagnosis. Please consult a medical professional.' <sup>80</sup>.  
    <br/>
- Answer follow-up questions based on general medical knowledge, always referring the user back to a doctor for treatment<sup>81</sup>."  
    <br/>

**8\. Future Proofing & Scalability (Plan B Strategy)**

8.1 Modular AI Architecture

To accommodate the potential switch from Google AI Studio (Plan A) to a Fine-Tuned Custom Model (Plan B), the backend architecture must enforce a strict separation of concerns82:

- **Service Interface Pattern:** The **FastAPI backend** will utilize a generic AIService interface<sup>83838383</sup>.  
    <br/>
- **Current Implementation:** GeminiService (Wraps Google API calls)<sup>84</sup>.  
    <br/>
- **Future Implementation:** CustomVisionService (Wraps calls to a local Docker container running a fine-tuned model like SkinGPT-4 or ResNet)<sup>85</sup>.  
    <br/>
- **Data Independence:** The database stores the **results** of the analysis, not the model-specific metadata, ensuring that historical user data remains valid even if the underlying AI engine is swapped<sup>86</sup>.  
    <br/>

8.2 Container Agnosticism

The application is fully containerized using Docker. This ensures that if "Plan B" is activated, the new custom model can be deployed as a separate container within the same docker-compose network without requiring changes to the React frontend or the core database logic87.
